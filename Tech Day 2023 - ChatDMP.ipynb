    "_Data management plans (DMP) required by funders provide a case for the use of generative AI in research. The highly structured DMP formats recommended by funders lend themselves to the formulaic approach of generative AI but require considerations of researcher engagement with and ownership of the DMP that is submitted. In this presentation, faculty from the University Libraries' Research Data Services demonstrate the potential benefits and pitfalls of AI-generated DMPs for meeting sponsor DMP requirements._"
