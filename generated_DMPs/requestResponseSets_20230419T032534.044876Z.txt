Introduction

The purpose of this IMLS Digital Product Plan is to outline the steps necessary for the successful management and preservation of data generated by a research project led by PI-2 in the subject area of Environmental Analysis. The project will generate 33GB of Instrument derived data, resulting in 26GB of CSV files that will be shared and preserved in the Dryad repository. The data management aspect of this project will be led by DM-2.

Data Management Plan

The first step in managing the data generated by this research project is to establish a Data Management Plan (DMP). This plan should include details on how the data will be collected, processed, analyzed, stored, shared, and preserved. It should also identify any potential ethical or legal issues related to the use and sharing of this data.

In order to ensure that all aspects of this DMP are properly addressed, it is recommended that DM-2 work closely with PI-2 throughout each stage of the research process. This collaboration can help ensure that all relevant stakeholders are involved in decision-making processes related to data management.

Data Collection

To begin collecting instrument-derived environmental analysis data for this research project, it is important to establish clear protocols for how these measurements will be taken. These protocols should include information about what instruments will be used; where they will be placed; when measurements will take place; and how often they need calibration or maintenance.

Once these protocols have been established, it may also be helpful to create a standardized form or template for recording measurement results. This can help ensure consistency across different researchers who may collect these measurements at various times during the study period.

Data Processing & Analysis

After collecting instrument-derived environmental analysis data from multiple sources over time periods ranging from minutes up through months or years depending on specific goals set forth within our study design framework - we must then process raw datasets into more manageable formats such as CSV files which can then undergo further statistical analysis. 

Data Storage

Once the data has been processed and analyzed, it is important to store it in a secure location that can be easily accessed by all relevant stakeholders. In this case, we will use Dryad as our primary repository for sharing and preserving these CSV files.

To ensure that the data remains accessible over time, we will also make sure to document each file using DataCite and README standards. This documentation should include information about what type of data is contained within each file; how it was collected; when it was collected; who collected it; and any other relevant metadata.

Data Sharing & Preservation

In order to share this data with others in the scientific community, we will make sure that all files are shared under the terms of the CC BY SA 4.0 Creative Commons license. This license allows others to use, distribute, remix or build upon our work - even commercially - so long as they give appropriate credit back to us (the original authors) while also releasing their own derivative works under similar licensing terms.

We will also take steps to preserve this data for long-term access by storing copies on UNM's LibNova Labdrive system in addition to any additional preservation provided by Dryad or other target repositories where applicable.

Conclusion

Overall, managing instrument-derived environmental analysis datasets requires careful planning at every stage of research from collection through processing/analysis/storage/sharing/preservation efforts undertaken post-study completion date(s). By following best practices outlined above including close collaboration between PI-2 and DM-2 throughout project lifecycle stages along with adherence towards established protocols for recording measurement results plus proper documentation utilizing DataCite/README standards alongside selecting appropriate licensing options such as CC BY SA 4.0 Creative Commons License â€“ researchers can help ensure successful management/preservation efforts leading up until final publication dates while promoting greater transparency across scientific communities worldwide!

The data will be shared under the terms of CC BY SA 4.0 Creative Commons license.

Data Management Plan

The first step in managing this large amount of data is to create a comprehensive Data Management Plan (DMP) that outlines how we plan on collecting, storing, preserving, sharing, and reusing our research data throughout its lifecycle. This DMP should include information about:

1. Data Collection: We need to ensure that all relevant metadata are collected along with each dataset so that it can be easily identified later on.

2. Storage: We need to store our datasets securely so they cannot be lost or damaged over time.

3. Preservation: We must ensure long-term preservation through appropriate storage formats such as UNM's LibNova Labdrive system or other target repositories.

4. Sharing: Our datasets must also be made available for others who may want access to them either now or in future years.

5. Reuse: Finally, we need to make sure our datasets are reusable by others who may want access at some point down the line.

To achieve these goals we propose several strategies:

1) Metadata collection - All relevant metadata associated with each dataset should be collected at creation time including instrument type used for acquisition; date/time stamping; calibration details etc., as well as any additional contextual information deemed necessary by researchers involved;

2) Secure storage - All raw instrument-derived data will be stored on a secure server with restricted access to authorized personnel only. The data will be backed up regularly and encrypted for added security;

3) Preservation - All datasets generated during the project will be preserved using UNM's LibNova Labdrive system or other target repositories that meet appropriate standards for long-term preservation of research data;

4) Sharing - We plan to share our datasets through Dryad repository, which is an open-access digital repository designed specifically for sharing scientific research data. This platform allows us to upload our CSV files along with any associated metadata and documentation in accordance with DataCite and README standard(s);

5) Reuse - Our datasets will also be made available under the terms of CC BY SA 4.0 Creative Commons license, which means they can be reused by others without restriction as long as proper attribution is given.

Conclusion

In conclusion, this IMLS Digital Product Plan outlines how we plan on managing, preserving, and sharing the large amount of data generated from a research project led by PI-2 with data management led by DM-3 in the subject area of Algorithm Development. By following these strategies outlined above we hope to ensure that our datasets are properly managed throughout their lifecycle so that they can continue to benefit future researchers in this field.
