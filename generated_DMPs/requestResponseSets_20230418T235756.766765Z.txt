Introduction

The purpose of this IMLS Digital Product Plan is to outline the steps necessary for managing and preserving data generated by a research project led by PI-2 in the subject area of Human Subjects Research. The project will generate 17GB of Instrument derived data, resulting in 14GB of CSV files that will be shared and preserved in the Dryad repository. The data management aspect of this project will be led by DM-1.

Data Management Plan

The first step in managing the data generated by this research project is to ensure that it is properly documented using standard metadata formats such as DataCite and README. This documentation should include information about how the data was collected, what instruments were used, any ethical considerations related to human subjects research, and any other relevant details.

Once the data has been properly documented, it can then be shared with others under the terms of a Creative Commons license (CC BY SA 4.0). This license allows others to use and build upon the work while also requiring them to give credit to the original authors.

To ensure long-term preservation of these valuable datasets beyond their initial deposit into Dryad, we recommend utilizing UNM's LibNova Labdrive system for additional backup storage options. By doing so we are able to provide an extra layer of protection against potential loss or corruption over time due either through technical failure or natural disaster events.

Conclusion

In conclusion, proper management and preservation strategies must be implemented when dealing with large amounts of instrument-derived human subjects research datasets like those produced during our proposed study. We believe that following best practices such as documenting metadata using standardized formats like DataCite/READMEs; sharing under appropriate licensing agreements; utilizing multiple repositories for backup storage purposes including UNM's LibNova Labdrive system all contribute towards ensuring maximum accessibility while minimizing risk factors associated with digital asset loss over time.
